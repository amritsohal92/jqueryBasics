        Jquery Basics:
        - Concept of DOM
        - How jQuery interacts with DOM.
        - hello World program.

        Concept of DOM:
        - It stands for document object model.
        - When a webpage is loaded, browser creates a Document Object Model of it.
        - DOM defines the standards for accessing documents.
        - You can think of HTML DOM as a programming mapping for HTML through which HTML elements start acting like Objects. They have their own properties, methods and events.

        - You should wrap all your jquery or JS code in Document Ready function.
        - Install jquery in page by using the CDN url.
        - Create document ready function.
        - Start writing your jQuery code inside it.

        $(document).ready(function(){
        //write code here
        });

        Playing with HTML using jquery
        - JQuery Syntax
        - Manipulating HTML with Jquery
        - Some Do's and Don'ts

        JQuery Syntax:
        - Syntax is quite literal and easy to understand.
        $(Selector).action();
        - $ sign denotes jquery function.
        - Selector selects the HTML element.
        - . is a separator
        - action is to perform action on a selected element. Example below
    <!-- Preferred is to download jQuery file and add in script tag, instead of using CDN like it is used now.-->

    <!--
        <script type="text/javascript">
            $(document).ready(function () { //this is the callback function. you can define it outside ready function and call it here.
    
                alert("document is ready")
    
            }); // end document ready function 
    
            another way for callback function, not recommended.
            function showAlert(){
            alert("document is ready")  
            }
            $(document).ready(showAlert());
    
        </script>
    -->
